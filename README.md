# GigaDex GUI

This repo provides full access to trade on the GigaDEX LootBox market. 

I hacked it together last night.

To be user friendly is needs:
1) guided keypair generation and token (lot) account creation
2) User account creation
3) For user to provide their own RPC url (ideally one that doesnn't suck balls.)
4) A ton of convenience features for doing normal trades.


Currently, this repo is optimized to allow my BE guys to easily test new RPCs and their infra in general. 

Also, it uses a pretty sick rapid-prototyping framework that can do pretty much anything like a video game.
